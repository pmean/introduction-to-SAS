This page shows the links to important files used in Module06 of MEDB 5507, Introduction to SAS, taught by Steve Simon. This class is taught at the University of Missouri-Kansas City in the Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics. This course uses the Canvas Learning Management System. If you are enrolled in this class, but do not have access to the Canvas website, please let me know immediately. This github repository is not a substitute for the Canvas site. I use it to organize files. Then I either copy-and-paste the information to the Canvas site or include links from the Canvas website to this repository.

All of the text, programs, and output are public domain. That means that you can use or modify the program in any way you please without asking for permission first. You are encouraged to cite the github site

**General Policies for UMKC Courses**

Will I be dropped from class if I not attend class?  What happens if I do not attend class without communicating with my instructor?
  Maintaining accurate enrollment records throughout the term is a partnership between instructors and students.  Instructors are responsible for verifying student attendance and participation within the first three weeks (16 week course) through the Attendance Verification Survey (administered through UMKC Connect) as well as maintain records of participation throughout the term so that the last date of attendance for students with recorded "F" or "W" final grades may be submitted.  Because student plans for enrollment sometimes change prior to the semester start, students not engaging in courses through the initial weeks of each course may be administratively dropped.  For more detailed information regarding the policy, [click here](https://catalog.umkc.edu/undergraduate-academic-regulations-information/registration/administrative-drop-policy/)

How do I get permission before recording class sessions?
  Instructor(s) may record class sessions for the sole purpose of sharing the recording with students who can't attend class. Instructor(s) will take care not to disclose personally identifiable information from the student education records during the recorded lesson. Students are not permitted to record class sessions without written consent from the course instructor.

Course Expectations, Course Policies, Requirements and Standards for Student Coursework and Student Behavior
  You are expected to do your homework independently. You can seek help from your instructors, from colleagues, or from the Internet to help decode an error message that you don't understand. You can adapt code that you find on the Internet. We recommend that you acknowledge the source for that code in the comments of your program, but this is not required.

Evaluation and Grading
  Students will be required to post messages on the Canvas discussion boards, take brief quizzes on Canvas, and submit homework assignments in PDF format on Canvas. Your work is due on the specified date. We need to keep the class on the same time schedule for a variety of reasons. If illness, family issues, work responsibilities, or other commitments prevent you from completing on time, please contact me before the due date. Late submission without prior notice will receive a one point deduction. If you find yourself repeatedly falling behind on quizzes and assignments, it would be good to set up a videoconfernce with one or both of us to discuss this.

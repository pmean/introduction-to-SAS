 abstract = {Statistical consulting is examined in terms of the stages of the first consultation, roles that a consultant can assume, and challenges associated with statistical consulting in a university. Some of the challenges that are discussed are (a) dealing with the human side of consulting, (b) consulting on an extremely wide range of research problems, (c) coping with clients having diverse statistical backgrounds, (d) dispelling inappropriate expectations about what statisticians can and cannot do, and (e) contending with a university reward system that penalizes those who engage in statistical consulting as opposed to those who pursue their own research.},
